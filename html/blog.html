        The Road to My Study Decision ⤵
    </h1>

        <div class="home-paragraph-background-inside-box">

            <p class="blog-paragraph">Choosing the right study program has been an important step for me, and
                I’d like to share how I approached it and what I hope to achieve in the future.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">My Background</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">In my prior education, I followed the Information Technology profile. This
                helped me develop a strong foundation in computer systems, software, and technical
                problem-solving. I’ve always been curious about how technology works and how it can be used to
                solve real-world problems. Although I haven’t studied at a university or a university of applied
                sciences before, I’m ready and motivated to take this next step in my education.

                Reflecting on my personal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats has helped me better

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Strengths</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">I consider my strongest qualities to be communication, creativity, and motivation.
                Being able to express ideas
                clearly and work well with others helps me collaborate effectively on projects. I also enjoy thinking
                outside
                the box to find creative solutions, which makes problem-solving more exciting. My motivation drives me
                to keep
                learning and pushing myself, even when challenges arise.

                So far, my programming experience mainly comes from learning c++ during my school courses. I have also
                taken the initiative to self-learn CSS and HTML, which has helped me build a basic understanding of how
                websites are structured and styled.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Before I even began my degree, I had to complete an assignment that was all about thinking through why I
                chose this path, what I’m good at, where I struggle, and what I want to achieve down the line. When I
                got my feedback back, it felt like a real eye-opener. It helped me understand what the program would be
                like and gave me some early tips on how to get better.

                In today’s fast-paced digital era, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a pivotal role
                in shaping the way we live, work, and interact. From smartphones and cloud computing to artificial
                intelligence and cybersecurity, ICT is at the heart of innovation and progress across virtually every
                industry.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">What is ICT?</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">ICT refers to technologies that provide access to information through
                telecommunications. It includes the internet, wireless networks, mobile phones, computers, software, and
                other media applications that enable communication and data exchange. The sector covers a broad range of
                jobs, from software developers and network engineers to data analysts and cybersecurity experts.
                Growing Demand and Opportunities
                The demand for ICT professionals has skyrocketed in recent years and is expected to continue rising.
                Businesses and governments alike are investing heavily in digital infrastructure, creating countless job
                opportunities. The shift toward remote work, online services, and automation has only accelerated this
                trend.
