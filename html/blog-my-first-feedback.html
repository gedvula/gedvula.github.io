                Before I even began my degree, I had to complete an assignment that was all about thinking through why I
                chose this path, what I’m good at, where I struggle, and what I want to achieve down the line. When I
                got my feedback back, it felt like a real eye-opener. It helped me understand what the program would be
                like and gave me some early tips on how to get better.

                The feedback mainly pointed out how I put my ideas together and shared them. It was clear that I’d done
                some solid self-reflection, but it also encouraged me to dig a bit deeper in some places. For example,
                when I explained why I picked this course or my career plans, the suggestion was to give specific
                examples and explain why those choices really mattered to me. That made me realize I tend to keep things
                a bit vague sometimes, and adding more detail would make my answers more powerful and easier to follow.
                I took the feedback really well. Instead of feeling criticized, I saw it as guidance to help me improve.
                It showed me that feedback isn’t just about spotting flaws but about helping me grow. I also appreciated
                that the comments didn’t just say what was wrong—they gave me clear advice on how to fix it.
                Looking back, this first feedback was super valuable. It reminded me that university is about more than
                just learning facts; it’s about building skills like thinking critically, communicating clearly, and
                reflecting on yourself. It also motivated me to welcome feedback from the start, knowing it’ll be key to
                my success throughout my studies.
