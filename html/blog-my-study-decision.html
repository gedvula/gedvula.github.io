    The Road to My Study Decision

            <p class="blog-paragraph">Choosing the right study program has been an important step for me, and
                I’d like to share how I approached it and what I hope to achieve in the future.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">My Background</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">In my prior education, I followed the Information Technology profile. This
                helped me develop a strong foundation in computer systems, software, and technical
                problem-solving. I’ve always been curious about how technology works and how it can be used to
                solve real-world problems. Although I haven’t studied at a university or a university of applied
                sciences before, I’m ready and motivated to take this next step in my education.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Study Choice Activities</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">To help guide my decision, I took part in several study choice activities.
                I completed a study choice test, joined an online information session, and had a chat with a
                student via hz.nl. The conversation with the student was especially helpful—it gave me a clear,
                honest view of what to expect from the program, the study environment, and how daily life as a
                student really looks. These activities helped me feel more confident that I’m choosing the right
                path.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">My Future Plans</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">After completing the program, I see myself working as a web developer.
                I’ve always been fascinated by how websites and applications work, and I enjoy the challenge of
                writing code to solve problems. The idea of creating websites and tools that people use every
                day excites me, especially because web development is a field that’s always growing and
                changing.
                Over the next few years, I want to develop a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end
                web development. I aim to become skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like
                React or Node.js. I also want to learn how to build responsive, user-friendly applications that
                are both functional and visually appealing.
                At the same time, I hope to grow as a problem-solver and learn how to work well in a
                professional development team. In four years, I want to graduate with the technical and soft
                skills needed to make a real impact in the world of web development.
