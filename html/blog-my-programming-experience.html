                So far, my programming experience mainly comes from learning c++ during my school courses. I have also
                taken the initiative to self-learn CSS and HTML, which has helped me build a basic understanding of how
                websites are structured and styled.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                While my experience is still growing, Iâ€™m eager to deepen my skills in web development, especially by
                learning more programming languages and frameworks in the future.
